# PyQt5 Calculator with Python Testing

## Project Overview

This project is a simple calculator application built using PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI). The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with different Python testing frameworks, specifically `unittest` and `pytest`.

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Alongside the application, a set of unit tests has been implemented to ensure the functionality of the operations.
